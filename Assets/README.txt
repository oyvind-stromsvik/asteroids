LICENSE/COPYRIGHT
=================
Sound effects are taken from classicgaming.cc (link at the bottom) so they
belong to them, no idea what license applies to them to check that out for
yourself if you intend to use the same sounds for whatever purpose. Everything 
else is made by me and you're free to do whatever you want with it.

ROADMAP

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================
The game is based on the classic Asteroids, but mostly on this:
http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/asteroids/index.php

The server highscore code is included, but I've removed the end points and
secret keys needed to interact with my server from the project for obvious reasons.
